This is the very first blog post I'm making on this github.io page.
I plan to use this at first to organize my study materials that I might still find useful after exams.
And after that maybe as a regular place to blog about random things.

The first topic I'll be documenting is crypto, though most of it is actually about channel and source encoding/decoding, only the last part is actually cryptography.

Eventually I'll also use it for ctf writeups.
